    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed."

    "### Why Anaconda?\n",
    "* User level install of the version of python you want\n",
    "* Able to install/update packages completely independent of system libraries or admin privileges\n",
    "* conda tool installs binary packages, rather than requiring compile resources like pip - again, handy if you have limited privileges for installing necessary libraries.\n",
    "* More or less eliminates the headaches of trying to figure out which version/release of package X is compatible with which version/release of package Y, both of which are required for the install of package Z\n",
    "* Comes either in full-meal-deal version, with numpy, scipy, PyQt, spyder IDE, etc. or in minimal / alacarte version (miniconda) where you can install what you want, when you need it\n",
    "* No risk of messing up required system libraries"
